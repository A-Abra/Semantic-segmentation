This also had an effect on how the graphs look like for both the training and validation loss vs epochs with only three points being plotted on the line graph. The precision/recall curves weren't able to be plotted on time. The training loss and validation loss graph shows an underfit with a decreasing trend while the IoU graph shows a major overfit with an increasing trend.
We could not get through with graphing the precision and recall curves on time so we cannot comment on the issue.
